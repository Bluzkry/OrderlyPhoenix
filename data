'To start coding, we need a way to 'save' the values from our coding. We do this by defining a variable with a name that will be tied to that value just as the value is tied to the variable name. Once you create (or declare) a variable as having a particular name, you can then call up that value by typing the variable name. The way to declare a variable is: var bananas;',
